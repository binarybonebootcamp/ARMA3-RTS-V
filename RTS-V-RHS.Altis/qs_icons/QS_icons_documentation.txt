Installation:

	- It is advised to Disable 'Extended Map Info' in your servers difficulty if you are using this script. Map=0; and ExtendedInfoType=0; (arma3Profile). https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Dedicated_Server
	- Copy/Paste the below line into your 'initPlayerLocal.sqf' mission directory file as shown in the example mission.
		[] execVM "scripts\QS_icons.sqf";
	- Open "QS_icons.sqf" and adjust the Configuration to your liking.
	- Report any bugs to the Forum Topic.
	
Known Bugs / Quirks:

	- When interactive group Map icons are enabled, you have to click on the squad leader, not the actual icon. The squad leader may be offset slightly from the icon (configurable).
	- If 2 Groups are in the same vehicle, their Icons and Icon Text will overlap. There is no easy solution to this issue.
	- When clicking on a vehicle to expand and reveal its crew occupants, it is sometimes unstable and selects the wrong vehicle (if two are close by) or none at all. 
			The click detection spot is actually 50m up and to the left of where the person clicks the map/where the vehicle is. If there are 2 vehicles very near each other, this is useful to know.
			Doesn't work so well for air vehicles which are high off the ground
	- Some of the configuration options may nullify one another, especially those with 'Only' in the variable name. In future versions I'll make the config options more modular.
	- Slight delay when hiding/revealing group icons on the map display, more pronounced in scenarios with many groups.
